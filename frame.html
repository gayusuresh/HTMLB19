              Lemurs &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; are primates found exclusively
              in the isolated island of Madagascar. Lemurs are primates just like apes
              and monkeys, but they evolved independently and are unique. The numbers
              of lemurs are dwindling due to poaching and other destructive human
              activities. Lemurs are worth more than $2 Trillion. In fact, no amount
              of money can ever buy one. So, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; protect
              lemurs!
